Celine Abu Shakra is a highly motivated computer science student with a strong focus on software engineering, data structures, and intelligent systems. She is currently pursuing her undergraduate studies in Computer Science, specializing in software engineering, and has demonstrated consistent academic excellence throughout her studies.

From an early stage in her education, Celine showed a deep interest in analytical thinking, problem-solving, and complex systems. This interest developed into a strong passion for computer science, particularly in areas such as algorithms, data structures, operating systems, and machine learning. She has worked extensively with programming languages including Python, C, C++, Java, SQL, and R, and is comfortable working in Linux-based development environments.

Celine has significant hands-on experience in building non-trivial software systems. She has implemented advanced data structures such as hash tables, union-find structures, trees, linked lists, and dynamic arrays, often under strict time and space complexity constraints. In several academic projects, she was required to design systems that integrate multiple data structures while preserving optimal performance guarantees.

In addition to her systems and data-structure background, Celine has worked on machine learning and data science projects. One notable project involved sentiment analysis using classical machine learning models such as Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes, where she focused on feature engineering rather than deep learning. She incorporated linguistic features including part-of-speech tagging, sentiment dictionaries, holiday names, and temporal features, achieving strong performance metrics. She has also participated in Kaggle competitions and is familiar with the end-to-end data science pipeline, from preprocessing to evaluation.

Celine has recently been developing a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system combined with a multi-agent architecture. This system integrates document indexing, vector search, conversational memory, and multiple specialized agents for retrieval, analysis, and critique. The project emphasizes correctness, grounding, and robustness, including strict hallucination prevention, entity-aware retrieval, and safe fallback to general knowledge when documents are insufficient. Through this work, she has gained a deep understanding of modern AI system design principles.

Beyond her technical abilities, Celine is known for her strong communication skills and leadership experience. She has participated in national and international debate competitions, including Model United Nations conferences, where she delivered speeches in front of large audiences. These experiences strengthened her ability to articulate complex ideas clearly and confidently.

Celine is also deeply involved in mentoring and volunteer work. She has served as a mentor in programs aimed at empowering young students, particularly girls, in STEM fields. In these roles, she provides academic guidance, personal support, and motivation, helping mentees build confidence and curiosity in science and technology. Additionally, she has volunteered as an emergency medical technician, demonstrating responsibility, resilience, and a strong commitment to helping others.

Overall, Celine Abu Shakra is characterized by her intellectual curiosity, discipline, and dedication to continuous learning. She combines strong theoretical foundations with practical implementation skills and is particularly interested in building reliable, explainable, and high-quality intelligent systems. Her long-term goals include working on complex software systems, contributing to impactful technological solutions, and continuing to grow as both an engineer and a leader.
